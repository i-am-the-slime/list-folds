In this talk, we recap from April 2013, Explain List Folds to Yourself. We go back to first principles, defining and examining the definition for a list, then take a look at the ubiquitous right and left fold functions on a list.

We develop an intuition for how these functions work, in any programming language so that we can best decide when to apply them. This talk will be interactive with audience as we solve problems using our new knowledge as we
acquire it.

No prior understanding of list folds is necessary, nor is it necessary to have seen the 2013 talk. All those points, and more, will be covered in greater detail.
